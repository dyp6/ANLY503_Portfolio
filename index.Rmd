Hello!

My name is Douglas Post and I am a student in the Georgetown University Data Science and Analytics Masters Program. I am graduating in December of 2020.

Welcome to my website for the course Analytic Data Visualization (ANLY 503). This website holds all the homeworks and projects that I did throughout the course this semester. The tabs at the top will guide you through different menus to view the pages holding each assignment.
